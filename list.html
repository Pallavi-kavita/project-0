            Main Characters
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Damon Salvatore</li>
            <ul>
                <li>More than once on The Vampire Diaries, Damon demonstrated just how awful he could be. When he’s
                    initially introduced on the show, he drinks both Caroline and Vicki’s blood and manipulates the two
                    of
                    them for his own ends.</li>
                <li>Yet as the series went on, Damon gradually became a better person as he fell in love and started a
                    relationship with Elena. </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Stefan Salvatore</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Stefan’s longing for Elena was what starts The Vampire Diaries. Having lived a century and a half as
                    a
                    vampire, Stefan returns to Mystic Falls, the town where he was born, after setting his sights on
                    Elena.
                </li>
                <li>While Elena may have been his true love, he was with several other women throughout the show and
                    ultimately marries Caroline.</li>
            </ul>


            <li>Katherine Pierce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Over multiple seasons on The Vampire Diaries, Katherine proved what a conniving, devious vampire she
                    could be.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Caroline Forbes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Caroline had perhaps the most dramatic arc. She started The Vampire Diaries as a flighty teenager
                    obsessed with finding a boyfriend.</li>
                <li>However, by her final appearance on The Originals, she was a stable adult, comfortable in her own
                    skin
                    and happy in her roles as a mother and educator.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Bonnie Bennett</li>
            <ul>
                <li>When Bonnie was initially introduced on The Vampire Diaries, she was just beginning to realize she
                    was a
                    witch. Her learning curve from no magic to powerful witch was swift, to say the least.</li>
                <li>Bonnie uses her impressive magical abilities to help her friends any way she can. In fact, Bonnie
                    becomes the most self-sacrificing character on the show.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

            The Originals
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Elijah Mikaelson</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Elijah is a force to be reckoned with but he’s also the most reasonable of the Original Vampires.
                </li>
                <li>Always buttoned up in a suit, Elijah is considered the fair and moral Mikaelson who doesn’t let
                    emotion overwhelm him.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Rebakh Mikaelson</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rebekah, along with her siblings, was one of the first vampires. As an Original, she’s one of the
                    most powerful supernatural beings around.</li>
                <li>After a thousand years, there’s pretty much no one Rebekah can’t best in a fight. She’s even taken
                    on many lesser vampires at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Klaus Mikaelson</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Klaus is a fascinating study in contradiction. Imbued with an incredible power as an Original
                    Vampire/werewolf hybrid, he still longs for the affection and love he was denied by his father —
                    even after 1000 years on earth. </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Freya Mikaelson</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Freya is the Mikaelson siblings’ long-lost older sister. Unlike them, however, she isn’t an Original
                    Vampire, but a centuries-old witch.</li>
                <li>Freya was a bargaining chip in a deal her mother made with her aunt, Dahlia, to use dark magic to
                    fix her infertility. </li>
            </ul>

        </ol>
