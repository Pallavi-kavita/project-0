        A<span class="pallu"> vampire</span> is a creature from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of
        blood) of the living. In<span class="pallu"> European folklore</span>, vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and
        caused mischief or deaths in the neighborhoods they inhabited while they were alive. 

        Vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures; the term vampire was popularized in<span class="pallu"> Western Europe</span> after
        reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in the Balkans and Eastern Europe that in
        some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.

    Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture
     around the world for many centuries.[56] The term vampire did not exist in ancient times. <span class="jain">Blood drinking and 
     similar activities</span> were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was
      considered <span class="jain">synonymous</span> with the vampire
